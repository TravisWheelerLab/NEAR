r"""Writes a dictionary of all transitive labels to apply to an example.

Includes EC, and GO labels (Enzyme Commission, Gene Ontology).

The format is gzipped json from key (GO term, EC number) to
list of all labels that should be applied to this term. For canonical labels,
the values in this list contain the key itself.
For non-canonical labels (e.g. obsoleted labels), the value of this map for a
key may not include the key itself, thus describing a normalized form for
labels.
